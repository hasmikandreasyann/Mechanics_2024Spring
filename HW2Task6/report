Case 1: Varying Masses with Fixed Friction Coefficients
Input Parameters:
M1 = 5 kg, M2 = 3 kg, M3 = 2 kg
μ1 = 0.2, μ2 = 0.3, μ3 = 0.1
L = 10 m, dt = 0.01 s, total_time = 5 s
Observations:
M1 moves slower than expected due to the higher friction coefficient μ1.
M2 exhibits oscillatory motion due to its interaction with the rope and the ground.
M3 moves steadily towards the ground with a constant velocity.

Case 2: Varying Friction Coefficients with Fixed Masses
Input Parameters:
M1 = 4 kg, M2 = 5 kg, M3 = 3 kg
μ1 = 0.1, μ2 = 0.2, μ3 = 0.4
L = 8 m, dt = 0.01 s, total_time = 5 s
Observations:
M1 accelerates rapidly due to the low friction coefficient μ1, reaching a significant distance from its initial position.
M2 experiences less oscillation compared to Case 1 due to the lower friction coefficient μ2.
M3 moves slowly towards the ground due to the higher friction coefficient μ3.

Case 3: Varying Rope Lengths
Input Parameters:
M1 = 2 kg, M2 = 3 kg, M3 = 4 kg
μ1 = 0.3, μ2 = 0.2, μ3 = 0.1
L = 6 m, dt = 0.01 s, total_time = 5 s
Observations:
Shortening the rope (L) results in faster motion for all masses due to reduced resistance.
M1 moves a shorter distance compared to longer rope lengths.
M2 exhibits quicker oscillations with shorter rope lengths.
